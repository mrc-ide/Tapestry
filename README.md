# Tapestry

Malaria infections often contain multiple genotypes, and when sequenced together
these produce a complex signal that is a mixture of the individual genotypes.
Building on the framework of earlier programs like DEploid and DEploidIBD,
Tapestry attempts to pull these individual genotypes apart by exploiting allele
frequency imbalances within a sample, while simultaneously estimating segments
of identity by descent (IBD) between sequences. Unlike previous programs,
Tapestry uses advanced MCMC methods to ensure that results are robust even for
high complexity of infection (COI).


## Model

We imagine a scenario where our sequencing data is generated by a fixed number of genetically distinct strains, which may or may not share regions of identity by descent. Each strain is imagined to comprise a fixed proportion of the infection. The fraction of reads that are derived from each strain is influenced by this proportion.

### Likelihood

The likelihood is formulated as a Hidden Markov Model:

$$ P(\vec{X}, \vec{S} | \Theta) = P(S_1) P(X_1 | S_1) \prod_{i=1}^{L} P(S_i|S_{i-1}) P(X_i | S_i) $$

As such, we can compute it by defining initiation, transition, and emission probabilities.

#### Emission probabilities, $P(X_i|S_i)$

Given a set of proportions and haplotype states, we can compute the proportion of the sample comprised of the alternative allele (or rather the expected WSAF without accounting for error), as:

$$ q_i = \sum_{j=1}^{K} w_jh_{ij} $$

We then adjust for sequencing error by assuming two fixed error rates, $e_0$ and $e_1$:

$$ \pi_i = q_i(1-e_1) + (1 - q_i)e_0 $$

If we sequenced every parasite genome in the host, our resultant observed WSAF, $x_i$, would be exactly $\pi$. However, in practice we generate a finite number of reads sampled from the infection through a random process. The sampling variation is modelled using a [Beta-binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution):

$$ X_i \sim BetaBin(a_i + r_i, \alpha, \beta) $$

We re-parameterise the distribution to have better control over its mean and variance:

$$\alpha=v\pi$$ 

$$\beta=v(1-\pi)$$

With this parameterisation, the expected error-adjusted WSAF is:

$$ E[X_i|v, \pi_i] = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta} = \pi_i $$

as we sought. Additionally we have:

$$Var(X_i|v, \pi) \propto \frac{1}{v}$$

which gives us good control over the variance.

If reads were sampled independently, randomly, and with replacement from the underlying strain proportions, we would expect the observed WSAF to be binomially distributed. However, we would like to allow additional dispersion across SNPs. For example, genomic context can influence sequencing performance, and that context will be different for each SNP; SNPs with identical haplotype configurations should have more than just binomial variance in their observed WSAF. The $v$ term in the beta-binomial allows us to capture this additional dispersion.

Rather than explicitly inferring haplotypes at each site, we marginalise over all possible haplotype configurations by making our final emission probability a finite mixture of beta-binomial distributions. Each haplotype configuration, $\vec{h}$, corresponds to a particular subset of the $K$ strains carrying the alternative allele. Note that $|\vec{h}| = 2^K$, and we index these configurations with a superscript $b$. For example, if $K=2$, the $\vec{h}$ would be $\Set{0,0}, \Set{0, 1}, \Set{1, 0}, \Set{1, 1}$. In essence, each $b$ generates a mode in the multi-modal WSAF distribution.

Our emission probability at each site becomes:

$$ P(X_i|S_i, w_j, p_i, v, e_0, e_1) = \sum_{b=1}^{2^{K}} P(a_i, r_i | \vec{h^{b}}, S_i, w_j, v, e_0, e_1) P(\vec{h^{b}}|S_i, p)$$

The IBD configuration $S_i$ limits which haplotype configurations are possible, by restricting strains in IBD to have the same haplotype state. In addition, we assume each group of strains in IBD is sampled independently and randomly. Defining the number of IBD groups carrying the alternative allele as $C_{h=1|S_i}$. Then,

$$ P(\vec{h^{b}}|S_i, p)=p^{C_{h=1|S_i}}(1-p)^{K-C_{h=1|S_i}}$$
