Description: Malaria infections often contain multiple genotypes, and when 
    sequenced together these produce a complex signal that is a mixture of the 
    individual genotypes. Building on the framework of earlier programs like 
    DEploid and DEploidIBD, Tapestry attempts to pull these individual genotypes
    apart by exploiting allele frequency imbalances within a sample, while 
    simultaneously estimating segments of identity by descent (IBD) between 
    sequences. Unlike previous programs, Tapestry uses advanced MCMC methods to 
    ensure that results are robust even for high complexity of infection (COI).
